## Speech Recognition to Text using SpeechKit.
Recognizes the user's speech and then converts it into text and displays it using Speech Kit, launched in WWDC 2016. It first gets the access of the device's microphone and then enables the user to input the data through speech and then converts it into text format.

Speech Kit is the framework that Siri uses for speech recognition.

I made this app by following [this](http://www.appcoda.com/siri-speech-framework/) post from [AppCoda](http://www.appcoda.com)
