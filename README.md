Speech Recognition to Text using SpeechKit
A Siri-like app that converts speech to text using Speech Kit, the framework launched in WWDC 2016. Speech Kit is the framework that Siri uses for speech recognition. 

I made this app by following [this](http://www.appcoda.com/siri-speech-framework/) post from [AppCoda](http://www.appcoda.com)
